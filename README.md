# Number Reverse

A simple Python program that reverses the digits of a given number without changing its data type.  
The program works for integers and floating-point numbers, preserving negative signs if present.

---

## Description
This program takes a number input from the user and outputs the number with its digits reversed.  
It handles both **integers** and **floating-point numbers** while maintaining the original type:

- Integers remain integers after reversal.
- Floating-point numbers remain floats after reversal.
- Negative numbers keep their negative sign.

For example:
- `123` becomes `321`
- `-456` becomes `-654`
- `12.34` becomes `43.21`
- `-0.56` becomes `-65.0`

## Example Output

Number Reverse

Enter a number: -12345

Original number: -12345
Reversed number: -54321
